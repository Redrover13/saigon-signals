  "purpose": "Enforce strict guidelines for AI-assisted coding to prevent fantasy/hallucination and maximize Nx, GCP, and SaaS best practices.",
  "rules": [
    "AI suggestions must follow Nx, Next.js, and TypeScript best practices.",
    "Tailwind CSS must be used for UI, referencing shared-ui and design tokens.",
    "All code must be production-ready with proper error handling and testing.",
    "GCP services integration must follow official SDK patterns and best practices.",
    "No fantasy APIs, endpoints, or services - only implement what exists.",
    "Use conventional commits and follow semantic versioning.",
    "All imports must be properly typed and from legitimate packages.",
    "Follow the established monorepo structure: apps/* for applications, libs/* for shared libraries.",
    "Implement proper logging, monitoring, and observability patterns.",
    "Security-first approach: validate inputs, sanitize outputs, use environment variables for secrets."
